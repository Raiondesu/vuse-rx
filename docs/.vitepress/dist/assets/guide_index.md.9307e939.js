However, it tries to strike a balance between being specific for the purpose (<code>vuex</code>) and being very generic for all purposes (<code>vue-rx</code>).</p><p>When it comes to RxJS integration, the big difference from other implementations is that <code>vuse-rx</code> treats both RxJS <a href="https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>observables</strong></a> and vue&#39;s own <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>reactive objects</strong></a> as <strong>equals</strong> instead of focusing only on one or the other.<br> This results in a seamless transition form reactive states to observables and vice versa throughout the application.</p><h2 id="why" tabindex="-1">Why? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>A widespread approach to using RxJS in Vue 3 (or even Vue 2) often boils down to throwing away Vue&#39;s features where RxJS is used and replacing them with either native DOM API calls (using <code>fromEvent</code> and <code>addEventListener</code>) on direct html element refs, or creating simple subjects which are updated on specific occasions.</p><p>The first approach feels tedious and low-level, while the other is often limiting and, well, also tedious.</p><p><code>vuse-rx</code> allows to reap all of the benefits from both approaches without any of the drawbacks, while also adding some more benefits on top of that:</p><ul><li>Ease of integrating application logic;</li><li>Ease of use (most of the time - as simlpe as calling one function);</li><li>Seamless integration between Vue&#39;s reactivity and flexibility of RxJS;</li><li>Ability to use &quot;native&quot; Vue APIs in harmony with observables;</li><li>No need to worry about creating observables manually or losing control over them;</li><li>First-class TypeScript support;</li><li><a href="/api/use-rx-state">Sane state management</a> out-of the box;</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Thanks to that last one, <code>vuse-rx</code> also eliminates the need to use <code>vuex</code> for most projects that already use <code>rxjs</code>!</p></div>',11),r=[i];function n(l,c,d,h,u,p){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const b=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{v as __pageData,b as default};
