# Getting Started

## [What is `vuse-rx`?](/guide/)

`vuse-rx` is a bridge library:
it connects vue's reactive states and refs with rxjs observables and subjects
in a way that enforces separation of concerns and reduces boilerplate code.

It's fully typed and therefore has **first-class TypeScript support**.

[More details here](/guide/).

## Install

### NPM / YARN
`npm i vuse-rx`

`yarn add vuse-rx`

### Native browser

```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/vuse-rx"></script>

<!-- or a complete package with polyfills and etc. -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vuse-rx/dist/umd.js"></script>
```

## Use

See [recipes](/recipes/counter) or [api](api/use-rx-state) for detailed usage instructions.
